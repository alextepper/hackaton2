Hello Alex. here's my feedback on the code for the Simple blog-site, there are several aspects that I'd like to point out:

### Points for Improvement:
1. **Consistency and Typos**: The class `PostCreataView` appears to have a typo. Consider renaming it to `PostCreateView` for better consistency.
  
2. **DRY Principle**: Both `PostUpdateView` and `PostDeleteView` have a similar `test_func`. You could consider refactoring this into a mixin or a helper function.

3. **Explicit Import**: You are importing all views with `from . import views`. While it works for this project, it would be better to explicitly import only the classes and functions you're using.

4. **Error Handling**: For example, in `Profile` model, there is no error handling for image processing, consider adding try-except blocks or custom error messages for potential issues.

5. **Code Organization**: The code could be organized into separate modules, each dedicated to models, views, and utility functions, to better adhere to the Django best practices.

6. **Comments and Documentation**: Comments could be more informative and it would be good to have docstrings to describe what your classes and methods are doing.

7. **URL Configuration**: The URL paths in `urlpatterns` are mostly hardcoded. Consider using the `reverse()` function for dynamic URL generation.

### Points for Preservation:
1. **Good Use of Django's Class-Based Views**: Makes your code DRY and easier to manage.
  
2. **Login and Permission Checks**: Utilization of `LoginRequiredMixin` and `UserPassesTestMixin` is commendable for checking user permissions.
  
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Your code is clean and adheres to PEP-8 standards, making it easy to read.
  
4. **User Feedback**: Usage of Django messages for user feedback is well-executed. 

In summary, your code shows a solid understanding of Django's core functionalities. However, there are a few areas that could be refined to make your code more maintainable and robust. Keep coding, the future is written in lines of code!

Yossi.
